## Planning & Foundation

### 1. Define Your Vision Clearly

**The Golden Rule: Garbage In, Garbage Out**

Start with a strong, detailed vision of what you want to build and how it should work. If your input is vague or messy, the output will be too.

**Action Steps:**
- Think through your idea from both product and user perspectives
- Use tools like **Gemini 2.5 Pro in Google AI Studio** to help structure your thoughts
- Outline product goals and map out how to bring your vision to life
- The clearer your plan, the smoother the execution

### 2. Plan Your UI/UX First

**Design Before You Code**

Before you start building, take time to carefully plan your UI. Consistency is key throughout your entire application.

**Best Practices:**
- Use tools like **v0** to visualize and experiment with layouts early
- Decide on your design system upfront and stick with it
- Create reusable components (buttons, loading indicators, etc.) from the start
- Check out **[21st.dev](https://21st.dev/)** for AI-ready component prompts you can copy-paste

### 3. Master Git & GitHub

**Your Safety Net and Lifeline**

Git is absolutely essential. It will save you when AI makes mistakes and you need to revert to a working version.

**Critical Rules:**
- Always use Git - your codebase could be destroyed without it
- Commit after finishing each major feature
- Know how to revert to older versions when things go wrong
- This will save you from disasters in the future!

### 4. Choose a Popular Tech Stack

**Leverage AI Training Data**

Stick to widely-used, well-documented technologies. AI models are trained on public data - the more common the stack, the better the AI can help you.

**Recommended Stack:**
```
Frontend & APIs: Next.js
Database & Auth: Supabase  
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Hosting: Vercel
```

This combination is beginner-friendly, fast to develop with, and removes lots of boilerplate and manual setup.

### 5. Utilize Rules

**Your AI Assistant's Guidebook**

Rules is still the best solution to start solid. You must have comprehensive Rules covering your entire tech stack.

**Include in Your Rules:**
- All technologies you're using
- Instructions for the AI model
- Best practices and patterns
- Things to avoid

**Resource:** Find templates at **[copilot.directory](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)**

### 6. Maintain an Instructions Folder

**Your Knowledge Base**

Always have an instructions folder filled with markdown files containing documentation and example components.

**Structure:**
```
/instructions
  ├── components-examples.md
  ├── api-patterns.md
  ├── styling-guide.md
  └── common-patterns.md
```

This provides context to guide the AI better (or use context7 MCP for extensive documentation).

## Development Workflow

### 7. Craft Detailed Prompts

**Quality Input = Quality Output**

When you start building, your prompts are everything. Again: garbage in, garbage out.

**Prompt Guidelines:**
- Be as detailed as possible
- Don't leave room for the AI to guess
- Tell it everything you want
- If you can't craft good prompts, use Gemini 2.5 Pro to help create intricate, detailed versions

### 8. Break Down Complex Features

**Avoid the Hallucination Trap**

Never give huge prompts like "build me this whole feature." The AI will start hallucinating and produce poor code.

**Best Practice:**
- Break any complex feature into 3-5 smaller requests (or more)
- Each request should be focused and specific
- Build incrementally, not all at once

### 9. Manage Chat Context Wisely

**Know When to Start Fresh**

When the chat gets very long, open a new one. The AI's context window is limited.

**Context Management:**
- Large chats cause the AI to forget earlier patterns and designs
- Start new chat windows when conversations get unwieldy
- Give new chats a brief description of what you were working on
- Mention the specific files you were working with

### 10. Don't Hesitate to Restart/Refine Prompts

**Cut Your Losses Early**

When the AI goes in the wrong direction or adds unwanted features, don't try to fix the mess.

**Better Strategy:**
- Go back and refine your prompt
- Start fresh rather than trying to salvage bad code
- The AI will try to save its mistakes and introduce new ones
- It's faster to restart with a better prompt

### 11. Provide Precise Context

**Context is King**

Providing the right context is crucial, especially as your codebase grows.

**Context Rules:**
- Mention the right files where changes will be made
- Ensure mentioned files are actually relevant
- Too much context can overwhelm the AI
- Always mention components that provide necessary context

### 12. Leverage Existing Components for Consistency

**Teach Through Examples**

Mention previously made components when building new ones. The AI will quickly pick up your patterns.

**Benefits:**
- Maintains consistency across your codebase
- Reduces the need to re-explain patterns
- Speeds up development of similar components

## Code Quality & Security

### 13. Iteratively Review Code with AI

**Double-Check Your Work**

After building each feature, use AI to review your code for issues.

**Review Process:**
1. Copy feature code to **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (huge context window)
2. Ask it to act as a security expert and spot flaws
3. In another chat, ask it to review as a tech stack expert for performance issues
4. Take insights back to Claude in Copilot to fix issues
5. Repeat until Gemini says everything is 100% okay

### 14. Prioritize Security Best Practices

**Common Security Patterns to Follow**

Here are critical security patterns you must implement:

**❌ Trusting Client Data**
- **Problem:** Using form/URL input directly
- **Fix:** Always validate & sanitize on server; escape output

**❌ Secrets in Frontend**
- **Problem:** API keys/credentials in React/Next.js client code
- **Fix:** Keep secrets server-side only (env vars, ensure .env is in .gitignore)

**❌ Weak Authorization**
- **Problem:** Only checking if logged in, not if allowed to perform actions
- **Fix:** Server must verify permissions for every action & resource

**❌ Leaky Errors**
- **Problem:** Showing detailed stack traces/DB errors to users
- **Fix:** Generic error messages for users; detailed logs for developers

**❌ No Ownership Checks (IDOR)**
- **Problem:** Letting user X access/edit user Y's data via predictable IDs
- **Fix:** Server must confirm current user owns/can access the specific resource ID

**❌ Ignoring DB-Level Security**
- **Problem:** Bypassing database features like RLS
- **Fix:** Define data access rules directly in your database

**❌ Unprotected APIs & Sensitive Data**
- **Problem:** Missing rate limits; sensitive data unencrypted
- **Fix:** Rate limit APIs; encrypt sensitive data at rest; always use HTTPS

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### 15. Handle Errors Effectively

**Two-Option Strategy**

When you face an error, you have two main approaches:

**Option 1: Reset and Retry**
- Go back and make the AI redo what you asked
- This actually works surprisingly often

**Option 2: Debug Forward**
- Copy-paste the error from console
- Tell the AI to solve it
- **Important:** If it takes more than 3 requests without solving, go back to Option 1
- Correct prompt + right context saves massive effort and requests

### 16. Debug Stubborn Errors Systematically

**The Detective Approach**

For errors that persist after 3+ attempts and send the AI down rabbit holes:

**Systematic Debugging:**
1. Tell Claude to take an overview of error-related components
2. Ask it to list top suspects causing the error
3. Have it add comprehensive logs
4. Provide the log output back to the AI
5. This approach works correctly most of the time!

### 17. Be Explicit: Prevent Unwanted AI Changes

**Stop Unwanted Modifications**

Claude has a frustrating habit of adding, removing, or modifying things you didn't ask for.

**The Magic Phrase:**
Add this under every prompt:
> "Do not change anything I didn't ask for. Just do only what I told you."

This simple sentence is surprisingly effective!

### 18. Keep a "Common AI Mistakes" File

**Learn from Repeated Patterns**

Always maintain a file documenting mistakes Claude makes frequently.

**Implementation:**
- Document all recurring mistakes
- Add them to a dedicated file
- Reference this file when adding new features
- Prevents frustrating repeated mistakes
- Saves you from repeating yourself
