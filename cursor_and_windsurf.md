# Cursor & Windsurf: AI-Powered Code Editors

This guide compares two popular AI-assisted development environments: Cursor and Windsurf.

## Cursor

### What it is

An AI-assisted code editor/IDE made by Anysphere. It's based on Visual Studio Code with added AI features.

**Links:**
- [Cursor Official Website](https://cursor.com)


### Key Features

- **Autocomplete**: Natural-language prompts to generate or update code (you tell it what to do, e.g. "refactor this function", "add a new endpoint")
- **Smart rewriting**: Ability to apply changes across multiple files (bulk edits) via prompts
- **Codebase querying**: Lets you query your whole codebase (or large parts) with natural language
- **Privacy controls**: Features like a mode where your code isn't stored remotely, SOC-2 certification, etc.

### Strengths (Pros)

- **Familiar interface**: Easy transition for developers who use VS Code because of its basis on it
- **Powerful refactoring**: Excellent when doing large refactorings or multi-file changes via prompts
- **Developer control**: Good for people who like control - you give prompts, decide what to run, see the diffs, etc.

### Limitations / Things to Consider

- Might require more manual input (setting context etc.) than editors which try to automatically infer everything
- **Cost**: Pro features are paid
- Even though the AI is strong, outputs may still need checking, especially for business logic, correctness, performance, etc.

## Windsurf

### What it is

An AI-native IDE made by Codeium. Designed to help developers stay in "flow". Available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

**Links:**
- [Windsurf Official Website](https://windsurf.com)


### Key Features

- **Cascade**: An agent in the IDE that watches your context (files, terminal, edits etc.), helps with automating sequences of tasks (e.g. detecting lint errors, suggesting fixes, generating code across files)
- **Supercomplete**: More advanced autocomplete/generation anticipating developer next moves
- **Live preview/deployment**: Built-in frontend previews inside the IDE and deploy without switching tools

### Strengths

- **More automation**: Fewer manual setups because the editor tries to maintain context automatically
- **Flow-focused UX**: Good user experience especially for staying in flow (less switching between tools)
- **Tight integrations**: Built-in tools are well-integrated, e.g. linter, preview, deployments, etc.

### Limitations / Things to Consider

- More automatic behavior means sometimes you'll need to check carefully what's been changed/suggested
- There could be limits or costs for "advanced" features
- As with any AI-driven tool: correctness, performance, and maintainability still require developer oversight
