## 2. Auto Completion (Ghost Text)

### What is it?

GitHub Copilot can automatically complete your code as you type, providing suggestions right in your editor. This feature helps speed up coding by offering relevant code snippets.

### How does it work?

**Setup**: Enable ghost text in VS Code settings (accessible via the settings icon in the bottom left corner)

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl + Right Arrow**: Moves through the ghost text suggestions, line by line, to complete your code
- **Alt + \\**: Manually trigger Copilot's suggestions

#### Best Practices
- **Comment First**: For the best auto-completion results, comment your requirements before you start coding. Copilot uses those comments to generate more accurate code
- **Next Edit Suggestion**: Copilot can suggest the next logical piece of code you might need, making coding more intuitive *(may need to be enabled)*

## 3. Inline Code Generation

### How does it work?

- **Ctrl + I**: Triggers Copilot to generate inline code based on the context of what you're working on

#### Advanced Commands
- **`/doc`**: Request Copilot to generate documentation
- **`/test`**: Ask Copilot to create unit tests
- **`/explain`**: Have Copilot explain code or logic in simple terms

### Commit Message Generator
Automatically generates meaningful commit messages based on your code changes.

### Copilot Coding Agent

The Copilot Coding Agent can work autonomously in the background, much like a human developer completing tasks. The agent is tracked via the **Agent Panel** and can perform the following tasks:

#### Core Capabilities
- **Fix Bugs**: Copilot can automatically identify and fix bugs
- **Implement Features**: Work on incremental features, making updates or adjustments as needed
- **Improve Test Coverage**: Ensure that your code is well-tested by generating additional tests
- **Update Documentation**: Helps maintain and update documentation to reflect your latest code changes
- **Address Technical Debt**: Assists with refactoring code to make it cleaner and more efficient

### Workspace and Code Space Index
- **Seamless Integration**: Copilot integrates into your workspace, indexing your code for faster, more context-aware suggestions
- **Navigation**: Helps navigate through your codebase with ease
- **Context Awareness**: Provides suggestions based on your entire project structure

### Adding Custom Instructions to Your Repository
You can personalize Copilot's behavior by adding custom instructions directly to your repository, ensuring that it adapts to your project's specific needs and coding standards.
